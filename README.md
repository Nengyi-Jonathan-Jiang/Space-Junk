# What is this?
This is a simple [bullet-hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_hell)-style game written in HTML/CSS/JS. Click the "Load Game" button to start playing. Left/right arrow keys to move, or on
touchscreen, you can drag the ship horizontally. The objective of the game is to dodge the obstacles (wrenches, asteroids, and broken ships. Not to scale!) and eat golden hearts. Survive as many 
waves of obstacles as you can.
